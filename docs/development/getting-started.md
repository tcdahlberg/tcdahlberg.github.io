# Developers Wanted

Are you a developer? Great! How about lending a hand on the Summit Events App? We sure could
use you as many hands make light work. Here is how you get tapped in to the project:

- [Watch and star our GitHub repository](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App).
- [Join our Trailhead group](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/groups/0F94S000000kHi2SAE?tab=discussion&sort=LAST_MODIFIED_DATE_DESC).
- [Connect with Thad Dahlberg (our lead developer) on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thaddaeus/). You can message him there if you want to get involved in the project.
