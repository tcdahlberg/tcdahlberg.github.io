# Custom Templates
The Summit Events App comes with a standard template that leverages the lightning design system. This standard template is called "GeneralSLDS" and you have the ability to create templates for your organization/institution that meet your branding standards. We'll explain a way for you to do this without having any coding or website experience.

## Creating Image Files
There are essentially 2 images to create a basic template branded for your organization/institution. You'll want to grab images larger than what they'll be resized to ensure clarity. You'll want to find the following:
* Organization/Institution Logo
* Background Image

### Resizing Images

## Creating Visualforce Page
