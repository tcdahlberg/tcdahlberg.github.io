# Registrant and Guest Questions
Summit Events comes with [standard questions](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/summit-events-app-documentation/docs/standard-features/standard-reg-questions/) and [additional questions](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/summit-events-app-documentation/docs/standard-features/standard-reg-questions/) that can be asked during the registration process.  These fields have specific preconfigured field types (e.g. text, picklist, etc.).   The standard questions are configured on the Summit Events event pages.  You can select which ones you want to display, if the field should be required, you can even change the label of the question.    These may be all that is needed for most of your events.  If you have more advanced needs, Summit Events also provides the ability to create your own custom questions.   This page covers creating custom questions.

# Custom Questions
Some considerations to keep in mind when creating custom questions:
* A field is needed on the Summit Events Registration object to house the information entered by the registrant.
* A matching question is needed on the Summit Event that references the field on the Summit Events Registration Object.  Care should be used to make sure that the fields accept the same type of data.  For example, you would not write text to a number field.
* If creating a Lookup Field, a sharing rule needs to be set up to the object used for the lookup.   Sharing rules can also limit the types of records that are available during lookup.  For example, you may only want to include Accounts that have a specific record type or that are coded in some manner.
* The guest user must have read permission on the Lookup object as well as to the fields on the lookup-to object (In our example, Account) to any fields that are listed as “Lookup fields”

### Field Question Details Section
There are several types of question fields which can be created and the type will dictate what fields you complete in the Field Question Details section and in the Record Lookup section.  If you are creating a Record Lookup field, you will only complete the Map to Field in the Field Question Details section.
* __Map to Field__ - the Summit Event Registration object field to which this field should map.  Enter the API field name of the field you created here.  The API field name should end in __c.
* __Text Limit__ - determines the character limit on a text field.  This should never be longer than the field length of the Summit Event Registration object field where the data will be stored.

* __Picklist Values__ - Values that will display as choices in a picklist field.  Enter each item on its own line.

The record lookup section is only to be completed if looking up values from another object and field.   
* __Lookup Object__ - object that contains the field with the data to be referenced

* __Lookup Where Clause__ - using SOQL statement syntax, you can limit the records available for search in your lookup field.  The API name of the field should be referenced.  The WHERE clause follows field expression syntax. A fieldExpression is defined as follows: WHERE <fieldAPIName> <comparisonOperator> <value>.  Valid comparison operators include the following: =, !=, <, <=, >, >=, LIKE, IN, NOT IN, INCLUDES, and EXCLUDES.
