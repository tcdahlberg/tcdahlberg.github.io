# Event Instance Functionality

The Instance is often described as the record an individual is selecting as part of the registration process. This is the specific date(s) and time(s) of an event and required as a child record to the Event record. Once you [create your instance](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/summit-events-app-documentation/docs/Getting-Started/create-basic-event/#create-the-related-event-instance), there is additional functionality to support some differences between instances that differ in date/time, how guests are captured as attendees or if you're trying to share a virtual meeting link. Here is a recap on how to create an Instance as well as some additional functionality.

## Create an Event Instance

- Create a new Event Instance from the parent Event record
- Set the Instance title, Start Date and Time, End Date and Time
- Set the Capacity to something greater than "0" and status as "Active"
