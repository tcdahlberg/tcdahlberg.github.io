## Create an Event Email
Summit Events makes it easy to send an automated email to your registrant based on their registration status. This feature is a transactional based feature, meaning that it sends emails based on changes to the registrant's status to the email provided. It is not intended for bulk messaging.  For example, the Director of Career Services could use this feature to send an email to the registrant when they register for her career services event.  Let's take a look at the steps it takes to create the email message.  This post will cover the basic features that will work for most simple events.  

### 1. Click the "New" button

Starting from the existing Summit Event record, locate the Summit Events Emails related list and click the New button.  Depending upon how your system is configured, the related list may be found in the Related List Quick Links area at the top of the event, if that is the case, hover over the link to access the New button.  If it is found along the right-side of the event screen or bottom of the event page with other related lists, click on the drop-down arrow and choose New. When creating a new email from the event, the event name populates automatically.

### 2. Provide an Org Email

This feature is based on utilizing an [Organization-Wide Email address](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.orgwide_email.htm&type=5). The email address utilized will need to be accessible to All Profiles. Once the email address is established, from the drop down selection on "Select Organization Wide Email", select an approved and appropriate Org-Wide Email address. This is the email address that shows as the sender address and will be the address to which the email is sent should they reply to the email. Hit "Save Letterhead Settings".

### 3. Choose a Letterhead

This feature currently leverages the Classic Salesforce Letterhead template builder which can be found in the Setup menu and typing "letterhead" in the quick search menu. Once you have a classic letterhead created, from the drop down selection on "Select Classic Letterhead", select an approved Classic Letterhead. The selected letterhead is how your email will be wrapped. Hit "Save Letterhead Settings".

### 4. Select the appropriate Action and Sub Action Status

Choose the Action Status value of "Registered" from the Action Status drop-down. Registered is being selected as it is the default status when an individual submits their registration and it is common practice for the person to receive an email when they complete the registration process. Sub Action Status is optional.  No Sub Action Statuses are being used for this event so this is left blank.

### 5. Enter the Subject

Using the Subject field, enter a meaningful subject for the email. This is what shows as the subject to the person receiving the email message.

### 6. Enter the Email Content

Using the rich text editor, enter the deails of the email into the Email Content Field.  This is what will appear in the body of the email message.  API names of the Salesforce fields can be used within the email so content can be dynamic based on the registration information.  See Advanced Features for more information on this feature.

Note: Only fields on the Summit Event Registration objects can be merged into the email content. All API field names should be encompassed with merge brackets, often seen in the classic email template builder. Example: {!summit__First_Name__c} 

### 7. Provide a BCC Email (optional)

The BCC Email field can be utilized for any addtional email addresses that should be blind carbon copy on each sent message. When entering multiple email addresses, a comma should be used to separate the email addresses.  The blind carbon copied individuals will receive a copy of each message sent and is not a dynamic field.  

Note: this text area field allows value that has no more than 1000 characters. 

### 8. Save the new email

These are all the fields we need to complete for our simple event.  For information about all of the fields, see the Field list below.

*Note: Other Salesforce products such as Pardot and Markting Cloud have much more emailing and engagement features.*
  
*Note: We recommend creating an event email from the Event as this will automatically associate the event with the email. If you go to the Summit Event Emails object and create an event email, you will need to assign an existing event record to the Event field. If the value you input does not match with an existing record, an error will be triggered.*
